| EDC Extension for Asset Administration Shell (AAS) | Asset Administration Shell (AAS) data can be manually shared over the EDC by linking an EDC Asset to the HTTP endpoint of the specific AAS element. Additionally, contracts and policies have to be defined for each element. In order to minimize configuration effort and prevent errors, this extension is able to link existing AAS services and its elements to the EDC automatically. Furthermore, this extension can also start an AAS service by reading an static AAS model file. A default contract and policy can be chosen to be applied for all elements. For critical elements, additional contracts and policies can be placed. External changes to the structure of an AAS are automatically synchronized by the extension. | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/EDC-Extension-for-AAS), [more information about AAS](https://www.plattform-i40.de/SiteGlobals/IP/Forms/Listen/Downloads/EN/Downloads_Formular.html?cl2Categories_TechnologieAnwendungsbereich_name=Verwaltungsschale) |
| Data tracking by auditing data                     | Proof of concept of how to track data usage by aggregating audit-logs of different components in a single instance: The work presents a first proof of concept of how traceability of data usage can be implemented using the EDC Connector event framework and audit logging. In this PoC, the traceability of data is limited to the AWS dataplane. The EDC Connector logs which exact assets are stored with which key in the AWS bucket. With this information, data usage can be traced from the shared logs of the EDC Connector and the AWS S3 bucket. Elasticsearch was chosen as the instance to merge both logs in this project. A simple Python script takes over the analysis of the log data.                                  | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/edc-data-tracebility-app)                                                                                                                                                                                             |
